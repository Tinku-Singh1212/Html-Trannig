    <p>Wondering which historical monuments of India are the most popular with tourists? 
        India has 116 ticketed monuments in 19 states, managed by the Archeological Survey of India. 
        Out of the 116 monuments, 17 monuments are located in Uttar Pradesh, 16 are in Maharashtra, 12 are in Karnataka,
         10 are in Delhi, eight are in Madhya Pradesh, seven are in Tamil Nadu, and six are in Gujarat.

        According to information provided by the Indian Ministry of Culture to the parliament, 
        the Taj Mahal sits in first position, way ahead of the other monuments.
         (The Golden Temple is the only place in India to rival its number of visitors).
          However, what's particularly notable is that the Red Fort in Delhi has overtaken the Qutub Minar as the second-most 
          visited monument in India. What's also interesting is that some of the monuments, such as the Charminar in Hyderabad, 
          have relatively high footfall but low ticket revenue indicating that they're visited predominantly by Indian tourists rather
           foreigners (who pay a lot more per ticket).
